Description:
    This command sets up a hook by redirecting the execution flow from FUNCTION1 to FUNCTION2. Both FUNCTION1 and FUNCTION2 can be specified by name or by address. You can use the -a or --address flag to indicate that the next argument should be interpreted as an address rather than a name.

Examples:
    hook func1 func2
    hook -a 0x12345678 func2
    hook func1 -a 0x12345678
    hook -a 0x12345678 -a 0x87654321

pub const USAGE_WATCHPTS: &str = "\x1b[32m
USAGE: watchpoint '[--memory=<zone>] [--access=<rights>] [--size <size>] <offset>'

Options:
    --memory=<type>    : Specifies the type of memory zone to watch. Available options:
                          - 'stack' : Watches the stack using the offset relative to the RSP (or SP in 32-bit) at the last frame before the current one. The offset is applied to this RSP value and can be negative
                          - (default) 'static', 'static-mem', 'static-memory' : places a watchpoint at the specified offset (the specified offset must be an RVA, it will be calculated subsequently with the base address)
                          - 'virtual', 'virtual-addr', 'virtual-address': virtual address, an exact address in the process's address space

    --access=<rights>   : Specifies the access rights to monitor. Options are:
                          - 'r', 'R' for read (default=RW)
                          - 'w', 'W' for write (defau=RW)
                          - 'x', 'X' for execute


   --register=<register> : the register with which the offset will be calculated (the specified register must be the name of the architecture's extended register)
   --size                : Defines the size of the memory zone to monitor in bytes If not specified can be the size of the type to monitor, (u8=1, u16=2, u32=4, u64=8))
    <offset>             : Offset to apply to the watchpoint address. This can be positive or negative It is a required parameter



Note:
    - if you define the watchpoint on a local variable or from a register, make sure that when you define it you are in the correct scope, if you use a register, make sure that it is initialized at that time

Examples:
   watchpoint --memory=virtual 0x12345678                # Monitor an absolute virtual address with read and write access
   watch --memory=stack --access=r -20                    # Monitor the stack with execute access, where the offset is relative to the RSP value at the last frame
   w --size 2 0x2000                                      # Monitor an RVA address with a specific size

\x1b[0m";


pub const USAGE_VAR_DEF: &str = r#"
Usage: def var <name> <value>

Description:
    This command allows you to define and initialize a variable in the program.
    Variables are defined using the format: <type> <name> = <value>;

Syntax:
    type name = value;
    - type: The data type of the variable (e.g., int, float, char, custom structs).
    - name: The name of the variable.
    - value: The value assigned to the variable.

Examples:
    1. int myvar = 42;
    2. float myFloat = 3.14;
    3. MyStruct myStruct = {1, 'a', 42};

Special Features:
    - File Read: You can initialize a variable's value from a file using the "read" keyword:
      Syntax: type name = read <file_path> [size];
      Example: char buffer = read "data.txt" 128;
        - file_path: Path to the file to read.
        - size (optional): Number of bytes to read. Defaults to the file's size.

Error Handling:
    - If the type, name, or value is missing, an error message will be displayed.
    - If the specified file cannot be opened or read, an error will be reported.
    - If the type cannot be parsed or is invalid, the command will terminate with an error message.

Additional Notes:
    - Arrays: Use the "[]" syntax to declare arrays. For example: int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    - Structs: When using custom structs, ensure the structure is predefined

Limitations:
    - The "read" keyword does not support dynamic file path resolution.
    - Ensure the type and value match the expected format for the variable.
"#;



pub const USAGE_PRINTF_VAR: &str = r#"
USAGE: printf <test> <arg>

Description:
    This command formats and prints variables or strings based on a provided format string.
    The formatting follows a syntax similar to the C `printf` function.

Syntax:
    printf_var <format_string> [, arg1, arg2, ...];

Parameters:
    - format_string: A string that contains plain text and format specifiers to substitute variables.
    - arg1, arg2, ...: Optional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers in the format_string.

Format Specifiers:
    - %d or %i: Integer (signed).
    - %u: Unsigned integer.
    - %x: Unsigned integer in hexadecimal (lowercase).
    - %X: Unsigned integer in hexadecimal (uppercase).
    - %f: Floating-point number.
    - %s: String (from variable or directly passed as an argument).

Examples:
    1. Printing integers:
       printf "%d + %d = %d" var1, var2, var3;
       - Substitutes var1, var2, and var3 as signed integers.

    2. Printing a string:
       printf "Hello, %s!" "World"
       - Prints "Hello, World!".

    3. Using variables:
       printf "%s has a value of %x" var_name, var_value

Special Features:
    - Variables: You can pass variable names as arguments, and their values will be fetched automatically.
    - Strings: Strings can be passed directly in quotes or fetched from variables.

Error Handling:
    - If a variable is not found or its type does not match the specifier, an error will be displayed.
    - Format specifier mismatches (e.g., passing a string for `%d`) will result in an error.

Advanced:
    - Memory Address Access: If a variable holds a pointer, the command can dereference it to fetch a string from the memory of another process.

Limitations:
    - Ensure all variables passed as arguments are defined and compatible with their format specifiers.
    - Access to memory addresses requires appropriate permissions and a valid process handle.

pub const USAGE_DEF_STRUCT: &str = "\x1b[32mUsage: def func <name>

Description:
   allows you to create structures like in c, you put the type and the name of the field and you press Enter this will take you to a new line, to exit you must do ':' + 'q' (:q) and press on Enter, you can then use this structure during commands like deref etc.

Example:
   lisa>> def struct poop
   struct poop {
       uint64_t test;
       uint64_t test1;
       char* test1;

   test:
       mov rax, main
       call rax
